This project implements linear regression on a single-variable dataset (population vs. profit) using Python. It calculates model parameters (θ₀ and θ₁) through both closed-form least squares and batch gradient descent. The final model is used to make predictions for specific population sizes. An optional script generates a plot of the data and fitted regression line. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of linear regression, compare analytical and iterative optimization techniques, and visualize how model parameters affect the fit. It serves as an introduction to supervised learning and cost function minimization.
